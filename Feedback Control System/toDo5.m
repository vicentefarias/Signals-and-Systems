Can the specifications,
PO <= 16%, tr <= 0.5s, ts<= 2s,es = 0 and er <= 0.1,
be satisfied with the given compensator?

The given compensator will satisfy the specifications. Setting alpha equal 
to 8 and beta to 16 in the compensator function shifts the centroid of 
the locus to the left (from -4 to -8). Using the compensate function and
figure 5 allows for the specifications to be verified for K = 80. Since 
the new critical point occurs at -8, K = 80 results in -8 +- j4, which is 
just within the specifications valid range(Figure 5).
