To do 2:
Unit Step:
Which value of k yields the best result? Why?
Does the output ever reach the desired value?
K = 16 yields the best result. At this value of K, 
the system response approaches an amplitude of 1
the fastest (critical dampening). Though the output 
does not reach the desired value, the output does become
asymptotically close.

Unit Ramp:
Which value of k yields the best result? Why?
Does the output ever reach the desired value?
All values of k yield the same results (a 1:1 mapping
between amplitude and time). The output reaches the
desire value.
